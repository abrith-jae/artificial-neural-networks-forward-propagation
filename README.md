# Artificial Neural Networks - Forward Propagation
## Introduction
Build a neural network from scratch and code how it performs predictions using forward propagation. Please note that all deep learning libraries have the entire training and prediction processes implemented, and so in practice you wouldn't really need to build a neural network from scratch.

# Objective
1. Initalize a Network
2. Compute Weighted Sum at Each Node. 
3. Compute Node Activation 
4. Access your Flask app via a webpage anywhere using a custom link.

Here is a neural network that takes two inputs, has one hidden layer with two nodes, and an output layer with one node.
